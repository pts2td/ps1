Title: Problem Set 1 Answers
Author: Peter Simonsen, pts2td

Prob 1: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36

The Mozilla shows the Mozilla/5.0 is the firefox I have installed on my computer I believe. In the parenthesis is my operating system, which is what the firefox is installed on. Linux x86_64 is because I'm operating Ubuntu on a 64 bit platform. I don't know what AppleWebKit is.
The Chrome is the version of Chrome I'm using (and the actual browser I accessed the server). The Safari is data on what version of safari I (would?) be using? I don't have safari intalled on this computer

Prob 2: Rust is probably concered that modifiying a global variable without a getter and setter will be too insecure and wants it wrapped inside a function.
